#My Calendar
##Main Objectives

-   Avoid re-Schedule events or events that can't happen at the same time.
-   Schedule primary activities (learning, practicing, etc).
-   Separate a minimun time for my hobbies, laissure activities and social life.

##Secondary Objectives

###Priority System

1.  Assure main objectives (#1,#2,#3)
2.  Schedule commuting time and backup time if necessary
3.  Overlap activities I'm able to do while commuting (like metacognition or read)
4.
5.  Move the main activities as they best fit.
6.  Schedule the secondary activities in the remaining time
    fifth check: Check that #7 had the neceesary time along the week or in the day.
    final check: shorten the main activities if #7 needs it to and the rest of the time for the secondary activities.

### Hierachie of Priorities

###### 0. Commuting time and backup time (time to go somewhere and return)

    If I need to go somewhere

    	No commuting time needed

###### 2. Physiological needs (sleeping and taking a bath)

###### 3. Meal Time

    If I am at home
    	No commuting time needed
    Else
    	Calculate commuting time

###### 4. Exercise

    If Today I must work out abs and legs
    	Can be done regardless I am at home or not.

    		If I will run home today
