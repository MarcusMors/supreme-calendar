# My Calendar

## Main Objectives

-   Avoid re-Schedule events or events that can't happen at the same time.
-   Schedule primary activities (learning, practicing, etc).
-   Separate a minimun time for my hobbies, laissure activities and social life.

## Secondary Objectives

-   Schedule secondary activities with the rest of the time.
-   Schedule commuting time

## Event vs Task

event : pass even thought you aren't there
task : you can do, in a plaze of time

### Priority System

1.  Assure main objectives (#1,#2,#3)
2.  Schedule commuting time and backup time if necessary
3.  Overlap activities I'm able to do while commuting (like metacognition or read)
4.
5.  Move the main activities as they best fit.
6.  Schedule the secondary activities in the remaining time
    fifth check: Check that #7 had the neceesary time along the week or in the day.
    final check: shorten the main activities if #7 needs it to and the rest of the time for the secondary activities.

### Hierachie of Priorities

##### 0. Commuting time and backup time (time to go somewhere or return home)

if an event can happen during other event of lower or higher Priority, must end in +#Priority-number

two types of activities:
compatible with other events
incompatible

notification: you got no event right know, will you come home?
Yes - in half an hour - in an hour - before X time (specify the maximum hour)

##### 1. Mine and University's events (must be there events)

    If I need to go somewhere
    	Calculate commuting time
    Else
    	No commuting time needed

    If I will be in home
    	No commuting time needed
    Else
    	Calculate commuting time

##### 4. Exercise

    If Today I must work out abs and legs
    	Can be done regardless I am at home or not.

    		If I will run home today
    			commuting time is the exercise time and should be longer
