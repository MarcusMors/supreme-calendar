# My Calendar

## Main Objectives

-   Avoid re-Schedule events or events that can't happen at the same time.
-   Schedule primary activities (learning, practicing, etc).
-   Separate a minimun time for my hobbies, laissure activities and social life.

## Secondary Objectives

-   Schedule secondary activities with the rest of the time.
-   Schedule commuting time

## Event vs Task

event : pass even thought you aren't there
task : you can do it in a period of time

### Priority System

1.  Assure main objectives (#1,#2,#3)
2.  Schedule commuting time and backup time if necessary
3.  Overlap activities I'm able to do while commuting (like metacognition or read)
4.
5.  Move the main activities as they best fit.
6.  Schedule the secondary activities in the remaining time
    fifth check: Check that #7 had the neceesary time along the week or in the day.
    final check: shorten the main activities if #7 needs it to and the rest of the time for the secondary activities.
