1.  Priority System

        check twice
        first check: assure the main objectives (#1,#2,#3)
        second check: agend the commuting time and backup time. Activities I can do during commuting and backup time must end in ~#0.
        third check: move the events which are overlaped with communting and backup time, and can't be done at that same time.
        fourth check: fit the main activities in the rest of the time, then the #7.
        fifth check: Check that #7 had the neceesary time along the week or in the day.
        final check: shorten the main activities if #7 needs it to and the rest of the time for the secondary activities.


        Hierachie of Priorities
        #0 Commuting time and backup time (can't be moved, agended at second check)
        #1 Mine and University's events
        #2 Physiological needs
        #3 Meal Time (should consider the place of this event?)
        #4 Exercise
        #5 Main Activities

    ?? #6 Metacognition (Is it a must or not?)
    #7 Hobbies, laissure and social life
    #8 Secondary Activities

if an event can be during other event of lower or higher Priority, must end in +#Priority-number
